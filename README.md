# project-bedrock: A project cockpit for your AI agents.

### Every session starts with context.  
### Every important decision leaves a trail.  
### Every session leaves the project smarter.

AI can write code fast.

What it does **not** do well by default is leave behind clear, shared project understanding.

Decisions disappear into chat history.  
Architecture gets rediscovered.  
New sessions start from zero.  
And the next developer, human or AI, has to figure out again what changed, where, and why.

**Project Bedrock** turns your repo into a project cockpit for AI agents:
what we know, what matters now, and what to load next.

It works like the operating discipline of a strong team lead:
- every session starts with context
- every important change leaves a trail
- stable knowledge gets written down where the next developer can find it
- the project becomes easier to understand over time, not harder

With one command, your project gets:
- PROJECT-SHAPED MEMORY for architecture, decisions, conventions, and domain context
- A SMALL WORK LAYER for current focus, open loops, and recommended next actions
- PROJECT-LOCAL integration for **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Codex**
- lightweight git-friendly markdown that LIVES WITH THE REPO
- HTML, graph, and Obsidian-ready VIEWS for human inspection

Under the hood, it is just markdown files and a CLI.  
No database. No server. No hosted backend. No black box.

**The result:** your AI developers stop behaving like disconnected sessions, and start behaving more like a team.

## 📦 Install

**Option A — let your agent do it** (no pip knowledge needed):

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, or any capable agent:

```
Install the `project-bedrock` CLI on this machine so `bedrock --version` works. Handle Python and pipx installation if missing. Fix any errors along the way. Don't stop until it's working.
```

The agent detects your OS, installs Python + pipx if needed, installs the package, and verifies it. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

**Option B — manual:**

```bash
pip install project-bedrock        # or: pipx install project-bedrock
```

> **PyPI:** `project-bedrock` &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; **CLI:** `bedrock` &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; **alias:** `agent-knowledge` (deprecated)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Initialize the project** (run once in your project folder):

```bash
cd your-project
bedrock init
```

**2. Onboard your agent** — paste this into chat:

```
Read AGENTS.md and ./bedrock/STATUS.md, then onboard this project.
```

**That's it.** The agent writes stable knowledge into `Memory/`, current priorities into `Work/`, and every future session starts with better context automatically.

<details>
<summary><b>What <code>init</code> does in one shot</b></summary>

<br>

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Creates `./bedrock/` as a **real directory** inside the repo (git-tracked) |
| 2 | Registers the project in `~/agent-os/projects/<slug>/` so **every project shows up in one place** -- open it in Obsidian for a unified cross-project vault |
| 3 | Adds noisy generated subfolders (`Evidence/raw/`, `Views/site/`, ...) to `.gitignore` automatically |
| 4 | Installs project-local integration for **Claude Code** and **Cursor** |
| 5 | Detects **Codex** and installs its bridge files if present |
| 6 | Bootstraps the project cockpit (`Memory/`, `Work/`, `Views/`) and marks onboarding as `pending` |
| 7 | Imports repo history into `Evidence/` and backfills lightweight history from git |

</details>

## 💾 Storage Modes

By default, knowledge lives **inside** the repo (git-tracked).
Curated knowledge is committed normally; noisy subfolders are gitignored.

```bash
# Default: in-repo (recommended)
bedrock init

# External: knowledge outside the repo (not committed)
bedrock init --external

# Convert external -> in-repo later
bedrock migrate-to-local
```

## 🧠 How It Works

Think of the vault as your team's **shared project cockpit**. The goal is not more documentation for agents to blindly read. The goal is less context, loaded better.

### Project Cockpit

| | Folder | What goes here | Canon? |
|---|--------|---------------|:------:|
| 📘 | **`Memory/`** | What the project knows -- stable, durable, project-shaped knowledge | **Yes** |
| 🎯 | **`Work/`** | What matters now -- current focus, next actions, open questions, risks | **Yes** |
| 👁️ | **`Views/`** | Human inspection views -- generated site and graph output | No |
| 📅 | `History/` | Legacy diary layer -- still supported | **Yes** |
| 📎 | `Evidence/` | Raw imports: docs, ADRs, PRs, screenshots -- captured context | No |
| 📊 | `Outputs/` | Legacy generated artifacts -- still supported | No |

> **The rule:** stable facts go into `Memory/`, current priorities go into `Work/`, and generated views stay in `Views/`. Imported or generated material is never canon by itself.

### Memory Is Project-Shaped

Bedrock does not force every repo into the same documentation template.

- A robotics repo may organize Memory around `perception/`, `navigation/`, `localization/`, and `safety/`
- A SaaS repo may organize Memory around `frontend/`, `backend/`, `auth/`, `billing/`, and `data/`
- Bedrock itself may organize Memory around `product/`, `runtime/`, `cli/`, `integrations/`, `memory-model/`, and `views/`

## 🔌 Project-Local Integration

The project carries **everything it needs**. Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex all get integration installed automatically on `init` -- hooks, runtime contracts, and slash commands. No global config.

### ⚡ Session Lifecycle

Hooks fire automatically -- **zero manual intervention:**

| Event | Claude Code | Cursor | What runs |
|-------|:-----------:|:------:|-----------|
| Session start | `SessionStart` | `session-start` | `bedrock sync` |
| File saved | -- | `post-write` | `bedrock update` |
| Task complete | `Stop` | `stop` | `bedrock sync` |
| Context compaction | `PreCompact` | `preCompact` | `bedrock sync` |

The agent reads `STATUS.md`, `Memory/PROJECT.md`, and `Work/NOW.md` at the start of every session, with no prompting required.

### 💬 Slash Commands

These are how the team writes to the logbook. Both work in Claude Code and Cursor -- `init` installed them.

| Command | When to use it |
|---------|---------------|
| **`/memory-update`** | End of session, before logging off. The agent updates the project cockpit: stable facts in `Memory/`, current priorities in `Work/`, and a short summary of what changed. |
| **`/system-update`** | After upgrading `project-bedrock`. Refreshes hooks, rules, commands. Purely infrastructure -- never touches knowledge content. |

> A developer should never finish a session without updating the cockpit. The point is not to save everything. The point is to save the next useful context.

### 🩺 Integration Health

```bash
bedrock doctor
```

Reports whether all integration files are installed and current. If anything is stale or missing, `doctor` tells you exactly what to run.

## 🔮 Obsidian-Ready

Each project's `./bedrock/` is a valid **Obsidian vault** on its own. But the real payoff is `~/agent-os/projects/`: every project you've ever run `init` in is registered there. Open that folder in Obsidian and you have **a unified vault across all your teams' projects** -- backlinks, graph view, and full-text search spanning every codebase you manage.

One window. Every team.

<img src="docs/obsidian-graph.gif" width="100%" alt="Obsidian graph view" />

```bash
bedrock export-canvas
# produces: bedrock/Views/graph/knowledge-export.canvas
```

Obsidian is optional. Works without it too.

## 🛠️ Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `init` | Set up a project -- one command, no arguments |
| `sync` | Full sync: memory, history, git evidence, index |
| `ship` | Validate + sync + commit + push |
| `view` | Build site and open in browser |
| `doctor` | Validate setup, integration health, note staleness |

<details>
<summary><b>All commands</b></summary>

`absorb` &middot; `search` &middot; `export-html` &middot; `export-canvas` &middot; `clean-import` &middot; `refresh-system` &middot; `backfill-history` &middot; `compact` &middot; `migrate-to-local` &middot; `init --external`
