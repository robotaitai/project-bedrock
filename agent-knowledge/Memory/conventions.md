# Conventions

Coding patterns, naming, and design rules.

## Naming

- [[cli|CLI]] command names use **hyphens**: `bedrock graphify-sync`
- Python package uses **underscores**: `agent_knowledge`
- User-facing messages reference CLI commands, never script paths

## Code Patterns

- Shell scripts stay in `assets/scripts/`, invoked via `runtime/shell.py`
- Templates use `<placeholder>` syntax for substitution
- No emojis or icons in code, logs, or output (see project rules)

## Memory Notes

- Require YAML frontmatter: `note_type`, `area`/`project`, `updated`, `tags`
- `durable-branch` notes must include an `update_when` field in frontmatter: a plain-English description of the conditions that should trigger an update to that note. This tells agents when to revisit without requiring them to understand the whole codebase.
- `doctor` automatically detects potentially stale notes by comparing the note's `updated` date against `git log` on the source paths registered for that area in `refresh._NOTE_AREA_PATHS`. When adding a new durable-branch area, add a corresponding entry there.
- Use wiki-links (`[[note-name]]`) for Obsidian graph connectivity — they become edges in the graph view
- [[MEMORY|Evidence and Outputs]] are never treated as curated truth

## Shell Scripts

- Always `set -euo pipefail`
- Avoid `[ test ] && cmd` -- use `if/then` (see [[gotchas]])
- Find assets via `SCRIPT_DIR`, never hardcode paths

## Recent Changes

- 2026-04-28: Added `update_when` convention for all `durable-branch` notes; `doctor` uses it to detect stale notes.
- 2026-04-28: Documented that each area in `refresh._NOTE_AREA_PATHS` must have a matching durable-branch entry.
